## About Lending CLub and objective
- is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
- Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
- In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- Dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.

## recommendations
- Interest rate on higher tenure (60 months) loans has to be reduced further to control the default rate
- Strong correlation has been observed between public derogatory and public bankruptcies. Lending club
should not give any loans to customers with public derogatory records
- Loans given to Small business are tend to default more. LC should reduce or not give loan to this
segment
- Lower the grades, higher the proportion of charged off customers. Take more information and actions
before issuing loans to lower grade category
- Mortgage home ownership are taking higher amount of loan and becoming default. Set the range for this
category and limit to max 15k USD
- Lending club stop giving loan to NE and take extra caution while providing loans to CA, FL and NY
cities
- Higher the interest rate more the charged off customers. Take action on fixing the interest rate for
different category of loans
